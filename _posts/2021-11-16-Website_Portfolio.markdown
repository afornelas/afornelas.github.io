> An opportunity to learn web development and show off my projects all at once

While I did not need to code a website in order to create a portfolio, it had been years since I had last touched HTML and CSS. I then took this opportunity to brush up my skills while simultaneously creating a space online where I can share and host my projects.

My website is currently hosted at [afornelas.github.io](https://afornelas.github.io) courtesy of GitHub Pages. The underlying web technology that I used in developing this has been the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator to facilitate the development of individual pages showcasing projects.

## Jekyll

> Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more

The heart of this project is Jekyll's markdown to html conversion, which facilitates the process of writing posts to update my website with my latest projects.

In order to create a new post, I simply have to append a `.markdown` to my website directory, which is then converted into a usable webpage based on my customized settings.

While Jekyll abstracts the creation of new webpages, I still did the majority of the HTML "blocks" it uses to decorate my site myself. In certain circumstances, I created entire raw pages in HTML and CSS myself so that I can tune them exactly how I feel is best on a per case basis.
