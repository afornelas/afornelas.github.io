### These projects do not have much engineering merit, but still are a big part of who I am and therefore are included here on my portfolio, for proper engineering projects see [Projects]({% link projects.markdown %}).

While it may seem weird to sort extracurriculars and some of the other examples as a hobby, I feel as by definition this word encompasses them best:

<dl>
  <dt><b>Hobby</b> <i>(Noun)</i></dt>
  <dd>an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.</dd>
  <dd><i>"his hobbies are exemplary of his dedication"</i></dd>
</dl>
